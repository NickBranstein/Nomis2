After a hard fought battle, you were able to successfully decommission the mech-suit built by renegade Russian scientist Simon. But in the final moments of the battle, Simon slipped away and activated the base's backup defense protocols. 

Your primary mission reamins: Capture Simon and bring him to justice. Now, armed with a malfunctioning mech suit, you have just 15 minutes to find Simon, capture him, and escape the base before it self destructs. 

Good luck Nomis. We're all counting on you.
